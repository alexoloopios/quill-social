# 1. Executive Summary

QUILL Social is an accessibility-first social communication, reading, publishing, media, community, and collaboration workspace.

It is not intended to be merely another Mastodon or Bluesky timeline client. QUILL Social should combine the speed and predictability of the best screen-reader-oriented social clients with the organization, publishing, scheduling, media, collaboration, and optional artificial intelligence capabilities expected from a modern professional social platform.

The product should allow a person to:

- Read and participate fully on Mastodon and Bluesky.
- Manage multiple social identities without losing track of the active account or network.
- Organize posts, people, conversations, media, searches, GitHub activity, and projects into rich folders and smart collections.
- Compose short posts, long posts, threads, polls, replies, quotes, and media-rich content.
- Schedule content through queues, calendars, campaigns, recurring plans, and approval workflows similar in spirit to Buffer.
- Listen to audio and video embedded in posts through a first-class accessible player.
- Send content between QUILL Social, QUILL, QUILL Radio, QUILL Cast, QUILL Audio Studio, QuilleBeacon, and QuilleSync.
- Use AI, when desired, to summarize, explain, translate, describe, transcribe, organize, compose, shorten, expand, and improve content.
- Participate safely through strong moderation, filtering, privacy, notification, and wellbeing tools.
- Use every important feature without a mouse and without relying on visual-only state.

The primary design center is a blind keyboard and screen-reader user. However, the product must also serve low-vision users, Braille users, people with cognitive and motor disabilities, creators, nonprofit leaders, open-source maintainers, podcasters, broadcasters, and anyone who values a calm, organized, powerful social workspace.

> **North star:** QUILL Social should make complex social spaces understandable, navigable, expressive, safe, and deeply human.

---

# 2. Product Vision

QUILL Social will become the social operating environment for the QUILL ecosystem.

A user should be able to begin with a social post and move naturally into other forms of work:

- Save a post as research.
- Turn feedback into a GitHub issue.
- Turn a thread into a QUILL document.
- Turn a podcast transcript into scheduled social posts.
- Turn an audio clip into a QUILL Cast teaser.
- Add a shared radio stream to QUILL Radio.
- Bookmark an exact post, thread, podcast chapter, or audio time point through QuilleBeacon.
- Schedule a week of posts through an accessible campaign calendar.
- Ask AI to summarize a conversation, then inspect every original source.
- Prepare a long announcement in QUILL and publish it as a thread, a long-form article, or both.

The experience should feel native, fast, deliberate, and trustworthy. The user should always understand:

- Where they are.
- Which account is active.
- Which network an item came from.
- What an action will do.
- Whether content is public, limited, private, scheduled, or local.
- Whether AI is involved.
- What data will leave the device.
- What succeeded, failed, or still requires attention.

# 3. Product Promise

QUILL Social makes five promises.

## 3.1 Everything Has a Place

Accounts, feeds, timelines, conversations, bookmarks, favourites, media, drafts, campaigns, scheduled posts, GitHub activity, notes, and research can be organized through workspaces, folders, tags, smart rules, and saved searches.

## 3.2 Everything Can Be Reached

Every core action must be available through:

- Standard controls.
- Keyboard shortcuts.
- Menus.
- Context menus.
- A searchable command center.
- Context-sensitive help.
- Optional global commands.

## 3.3 Important State Is Never Hidden

The product must communicate account, network, privacy, content warning, moderation labels, thread position, media state, scheduling state, upload progress, and failures through accessible text and control state. Color, sound, icons, indentation, or visual location must never be the sole means of communication.

## 3.4 AI Remains an Assistant

AI can propose, summarize, describe, translate, classify, and transform. It must never silently publish, impersonate the user, hide source material, or replace human approval.

## 3.5 The QUILL Ecosystem Works as One

Content should move cleanly among QUILL products without repetitive copying, inaccessible browser workflows, or loss of context.

# 6. Guiding Principles

## 6.1 Accessibility Before Density

A visually dense screen is not automatically efficient. Every workflow must work in a focused, sequential mode even when a user also chooses a multi-pane layout.

## 6.2 Network Fidelity Before Artificial Uniformity

Mastodon and Bluesky have different concepts. QUILL Social should create a coherent experience without pretending their privacy, moderation, identity, and publishing models are identical.

## 6.3 Capability Detection Before Assumption

The application must detect what each account and server supports. Unsupported commands should be hidden or clearly explained.

## 6.4 User Intent Before Automation

Scheduling, AI, cross-posting, thread splitting, and media conversion must assist the user’s intent. They must not infer permission to publish or share private information.

## 6.5 Textual State Before Visual State

Icons, badges, colors, indentation, and progress bars must always have accessible names, descriptions, relationships, and states.

## 6.6 Local-First and Cloud-Optional

Reading, drafting, saving, organizing, playback, and many AI workflows should work locally. Cloud services should be optional for reliable scheduling, synchronization, collaboration, and hosted long-form publishing.

## 6.7 Graceful Failure

Social APIs, servers, uploads, and network connections fail. QUILL Social must preserve work, explain exactly what happened, and provide a safe recovery path.

---

# 7. Target Users

## 7.1 Fast Social Reader

A blind screen-reader user who wants fast startup, stable focus, configurable speech, sound cues, catch-up tools, media playback, and immediate access to context.

## 7.2 Community Leader

A nonprofit or community leader managing personal and organizational accounts who needs campaigns, approvals, schedules, saved replies, analytics, and clear separation between identities.

## 7.3 Creator and Broadcaster

A podcaster, radio host, audio producer, writer, or educator who needs long-form composition, audio clips, transcripts, chapter links, reusable campaigns, and QUILL media integration.

## 7.4 Open-Source Maintainer

A developer or project manager active on GitHub, Mastodon, and Bluesky who needs issue and discussion views, release announcements, saved technical replies, and AI summaries.

## 7.5 New Social Participant

A person unfamiliar with federation, instances, custom feeds, labelers, content warnings, or thread gates who needs guided setup, plain-language explanations, safe defaults, and previews.

## 7.6 Low-Vision and Cognitive-Accessibility User

A user who benefits from larger text, reduced density, high contrast, predictable location, plain language, saved progress, and reduced notification load.

# 39. Key Acceptance Scenarios

## 39.1 Read and Reply

A blind user can move through a timeline, hear configured fields, inspect details, open a reply composer with context, publish, and return focus to the correct item.

## 39.2 Long Thread

A long QUILL document can be transformed into valid Mastodon and Bluesky threads without splitting links or mentions. Every segment is editable and the thread publishes in order.

## 39.3 Scheduled Campaign

A campaign can schedule variants across several accounts. A failure on one destination does not duplicate successful content elsewhere and appears in an accessible Failed view.

## 39.4 Media

A user can begin playback without losing timeline focus, seek, change speed, read a transcript, create a time-point Beacon, and return to the source post.

## 39.5 Moderation Label

A Bluesky moderation label is announced with its source and current policy. The user can reveal, hide, or inspect without content being read automatically.

## 39.6 GitHub Feedback

A saved social thread can become a GitHub issue draft with attribution, private notes excluded, optional AI structuring, and explicit confirmation before creation.

## 39.7 Offline Draft

A post created offline is preserved, revalidated when connectivity returns, and not silently published after its intended time has passed.

---

# 40. Risks and Mitigation

## Scope

**Risk:** The product is extremely broad.  
**Mitigation:** Use P0, P1, and P2 priorities, vertical slices, feature flags, and adapter boundaries.

## Evolving APIs

**Risk:** Mastodon and Bluesky capabilities change.  
**Mitigation:** Capability detection, adapter isolation, contract tests, diagnostics, and feature flags.

## wxPython Accessibility

**Risk:** Some controls behave differently across screen readers.  
**Mitigation:** Early prototypes, native controls, UI Automation support, manual gates, and focused-mode fallbacks.

## Cloud Credentials

**Risk:** Reliable offline scheduling may require protected posting credentials.  
**Mitigation:** Native scheduling first, local-only mode, OAuth, isolated vaults, encryption, revocation, and independent review.

## AI Trust

**Risk:** AI may make mistakes or damage user trust.  
**Mitigation:** Optional use, source links, draft-only output, clear data disclosure, local models, and no autonomous engagement.

## Partial Thread Publication

**Risk:** A multi-segment thread may fail midway.  
**Mitigation:** Dependency tracking, delivery records, pause-on-failure, idempotency, and repair workflows.

## Notification Overload

**Risk:** Users may become overwhelmed.  
**Mitigation:** Digests, quiet hours, grouping, category policies, focus modes, and needs-attention folders.

# 44. Final Product Direction

QUILL Social should be built as a **social operating environment for communication, organization, publishing, listening, creation, and community participation**.

Its defining advantage is not one isolated feature. It is the combination of:

- Deep accessibility.
- Full network participation.
- Rich organization.
- Reliable scheduling.
- Thoughtful media.
- Optional AI.
- GitHub collaboration.
- QUILL ecosystem integration.
- Clear privacy.
- Human control.

This working PRD is intentionally broad. It captures the product vision and major requirements available for review now. Later revisions can convert each major area into implementation epics, detailed user stories, API contracts, database schemas, interaction specifications, and test plans.
